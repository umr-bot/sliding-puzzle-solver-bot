Do sarsa lecture 5 slide 22

simulate: takes previous state and action give next state and reward
want to use q because q doesnt need probs matrix
slides 13,14,15,19
Lecture 5 to get policy for grid world
Learning, Two ways to get into terminal state, and once in this state large reward

Check if using a matrix containing both postion and value for comparison
will work to check if probablity transition possible.

[0,1,2,3] == [0,1,3,2]

Results in [true,true,false,false].

[0,1,2,3] == [1,0,3,2] # ignore fact that [1,0,3,2] not solvable puzzle grid

Results in [false,false,false,false]

[0,1,2,3] == [0,3,2,1] --> [t,f,t,f]

[3,1,0,2] == [1,3,0,2] --> [f,f,t,t]

It seems that as long as there are two trues then the transition is possible from
one 'grid state' to another.
