\chapter{Applying reinforcement learning to sliding puzzles}
\label{chap:Experiments_and_Results}
\section{Introduction}
In the following section we will test the SARSA and Q-learning algorithms described in chapter \ref{chap:RL}. The way the tests will be conducted is by varying the hyper parameters. These hyper parameters include, the discount factor $\gamma$, epsilon the probability of choosing a random action and $\alpha$ the learning rate.

The puzzle that we will solve is of size 3x3. The way in which it will be solved is by training separate agents to solve different parts of the puzzle.
