Generally in robotics a manipulator (eg.
an arm) is used to manipulate an object in
the environment. It is normally easier to
first simulate the robots behavior in a
more simple environment. In this project
we try to solve a sliding puzzle using
reinforcement learning, where the same
algorithm can then later be applied to the
robotics problem.
